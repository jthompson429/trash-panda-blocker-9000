## 🐾 1. What Is Trash Panda Blocker 9000?

**Trash Panda Blocker 9000** is a DIY, humane deterrent system designed to help protect food set out for stray or feral cats. Raccoons are clever, persistent, and often consume large amounts of food meant for community cats—causing stress for caregivers and added cost over time.

This system uses a small computer (a Raspberry Pi), a camera, and basic motors to detect when a raccoon appears. If one is seen, a lightweight cover is gently placed over the food to temporarily block access.

It does **not harm**, **trap**, or **frighten** animals. It simply allows caregivers to prioritize vulnerable stray cats—especially overnight when food can quickly disappear.

## 💡 2. Why It Was Created

This project began with a problem:  
> “I was feeding multiple stray cats every night, but raccoons kept taking all the food. I couldn’t afford to keep up, and it felt like I was failing the cats who needed help the most.”

Trash Panda Blocker 9000 was born out of three things:
- A desire to reduce waste and protect limited food resources
- A deep love for a kitten that passed away before he could be saved
- A tribute to a stepfather who believed in building things that helped others

While it’s made with technology, it’s really about **humanity**—and a belief that even small tools can protect those who can’t protect themselves.

## ⚙️ 3. How It Works (No Tech Required)

This is not a trap. It’s not a weapon. It’s a **smart cover system** that recognizes raccoons and reacts gently.

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1.   | A camera watches the feeding station at night |
| 2.   | A motion sensor detects movement |
| 3.   | AI (artificial intelligence) checks if the visitor is a **cat** or a **raccoon** |
| 4.   | If it's a raccoon, a lightweight cover moves over the food for a short time |
| 5.   | When the raccoon leaves, the food is accessible again |

Cats aren’t scared by it. They tend to wait nearby and eat once the system resets.

## 🛠️ 4. How to Get One / Build One (Coming Soon)

We’re working on a plain-English build guide and printable parts list. Until then, if you’re part of a rescue group or local shelter:

- **Contact a local Makerspace or Tech Meetup** and show them this project
- Ask if someone in your community can help build one for you (it costs around $75–$120 in parts)
- Or reach out through the GitHub project to see if someone can assist remotely

> We hope to build a small support community of people who care about animals and know how to build tech.
